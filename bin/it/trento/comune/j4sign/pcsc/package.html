Classes for detecting smart cards and smart card readers via the PCSC interface.
<p>
This package is an attempt to make j4sign to operate seamlessly with PKCS#11 tokens provided by different
italian Certification Authorities;<br>
The {@link it.trento.comune.j4sign.pcsc.PCSCHelper} class tries to detect token readers and tokens, 
proposing, if possible, a candidate criptoki. (The criptoki is the native library implementing the PKCS#11 standard).<br>
<code>PCSCHelper</code> uses the <a href="http://www.opencard.org">OpenCard</a> PCSC JNI wrapper.
<p>

The obvious prerequisite is a working PCSC layer; this is usually true
if a smart card reader has been succesfully installed on the system.
